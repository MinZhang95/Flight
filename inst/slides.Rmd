# Motivation 

- Monster 🐑 said:" All flights are bad, but some are endurable!"

- In 2017, Monster 🐑 searched the flights from Seattle to Des Moines everyday and found this fucking procedure was fucking terrible -- then he decided to change the world!

- During 2018, Monster 🐑 endured hardships to beat all his coding enemies, and won out from STAT 580, ECE 526...

- In 2019, a trigger emerged: the great STAT 585 encouraged him to push the upgrade of the flight search engine and **FlightScanner** comes to the world!

- In the future, Monster 🐑 will lead our team to get more further steps and make **FlightScanner** become to only **ONE** flight search engine in the World!
